# ng4-bootstrap4-sampleapp

This is a sample [Angular 4](https://angular.io) application where we have integrated [Bootstrap 4](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com) and [ng-bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home).

In addition to this, we have also implemented the following - 

+ Routing
+ Child views
+ HTTP Client 
+ Typeahead implementation using ng-bootstrap 

### N.B.

> The project is still under development. But we feel that this is a good place for anyone to start a new project. We would be enhancing the features as we go along.
